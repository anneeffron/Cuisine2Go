# CuisineToGo

Project Overview:
Create a program that will allow a food delivery company to optimize their schedule by sending the closest driver to pick up available orders.
There will be a single Scheduler object which will handle all of the Orders and Drivers in the system. 
Program will assign active drivers to fulfill orders by picking up food orders then traveling to their drop-off location, and will update the GUI to show the current status of the system.

RoadMap:

March6: setup, roles, roadmap

March8: Pen and paper (app flow), Draw what the GUI system will look like, figure out research 

What We did: wire-framed GUI, started the application flow,

What We need: research loadbalancing for the schedule, completed app flow, finished GUI mockups
