We had to change Java 9 to Java 8

If you leave anything blank in an order the system breaks

Allowed to press schedule even with no driver/no orders

They do not have a visualization of a map. There is movement to and from places but it's just text moving.

They have a "Mr.Delivery" way of signing in. They do not have a sign out or amount of time feature.

It appears that their scale is off for their X,Y. For instance, I put a 12,13 location and while it does go to the top left corner
it goes to the very top left while the restaurant (should be 50,50) is very far away. What I am rambling on about is the scale seems to be off.

They implemented controllers to the driver instances but doesn't seem to do anything with it.

Again, any button you press on the home screen that isn't order or driver crashes this system.
